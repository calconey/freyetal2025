This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Objective
Fit a zero-inflated Dirichlet-multinomial (`ZIDM`) model to the compositional counts, and an extension to where the counts as well as potential zero inflation may be a function of the covariates.  The methodology is described in [Koslovsky (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1111/biom.13853). 


In this script, we will be showcasing:
 - a standard Dirichlet-multinomial (`DM`) model
 - the `ZIDM` (which accounts for zero inflation in the taxon counts)
 - their extensions to sparsity-induced regression settings, `DMbvs` and `ZIDMbvs` (bvs = Bayesian variable selection)
 - the [Tuyl method](https://doi.org/10.1080/00031305.2018.1444673) for individual-level count probability estimation
 
We have previously fit the `DMbvs`. This was described in the Wadsworth reports.

# Some notation
We have:

  - $i$ subjects (observations, rows)
  - $P = 1 \dots p$ covariates (rain, temp, rh, soil, rotation, etc.)
  - $J = 1 \ldots j$ taxa (fungal genera or species)


$\Theta_j$ = population-level zero-inflation probabilities for the $j$ taxa. 

$\Gamma_j$ = population-level count probabilities.  

$\psi_{ij}$ = individual-level count probabilities.  

# Parameter Estimation 
## A standard Dirichlet-multinomial (`DM`) model

Here we are estimating the probabilities of the `DM` for the counts of the fungal genera.

```{r standard-DM-fit, message=FALSE, results='hide'}
# Fit the DM model to the data (run for more iterations than the default 10,000)
tic()
fit_DM <- DM_R(Z, iterations = 20000)
toc()

# Obtain estimates of DM model
DM_est <- estimates_DM(dm_obj = fit_DM, burnin = 1000, CI = 0.95)

# DM_est is a list of six:
# Note there is no post_theta. Why? Because the DM model does not account for zero-inflation.

## Population-level count probabilities (14 because there are 14 taxa)
# post_gamma
# post_gamma_lower
# post_gamma_upper

## Individual-level count probabilities
# post_psi  # dim = 49, 14 of course, for each row and taxon
# post_psi_lower
# post_psi_upper

# Sum of the population-level count probabilities is ~1:
# sum(DM_est$post_gamma)
```

### Example of the individual-level probabilities
```{r standard-DM-individual-level-probs, results='hide'}
# Individual (observation) 1: the probabilities do sum to 1
sum(DM_est$post_psi[1, ])

# Note that NONE of the probabilities is zero, which is one of the characteristics of the DM model, in which the estimated probabilities of counts are strictly positive, even when the true probability of occurrence is zero.
sum(DM_est$post_psi[1, ] == 0)

# And you can plot the probabilities:
# individual-level count probabilities for individual (observation) 1:
data.frame(x = factor(colnames(Z)), y = DM_est$post_psi[1, ]) %>% 
  # Plot the data:
  prob.plot() +
  ggtitle("Standard DM Obs 1")
```

### The population-level probabilities
  
```{r standard-DM-population-level-probs}
# population-level count probabilities:
data.frame(x = factor(colnames(Z)), y = DM_est$post_gamma) %>% 
  # Plot the data:
  prob.plot() +
  ggtitle("Standard DM population-level count probabilities") +
  ylim(0, 0.25)
```

## Tuyl approach to individual-level probabilities
Another method for obtaining individual-level probabilities was proposed by Frank Tuyl. 

Koslovsky (2023) constructed a Monte Carlo sampling algorithm to obtain uncertainty estimates using Tuyl's approach. The following code chunk fits the probabilities using Tuyl's approach.

```{r Tuyl-individual-level-probs, results='hide'}
# Fit Tuyl's approach to the data and obtain uncertainty estimates via Monte Carlo sampling
fit_tuyl <- tuyl_meaner(Z) 
# These are Tuyl's individual-level count probabilities:
dim(fit_tuyl)  # 49 obs 14 genera

# Example: for individual (observation) 1, the probabilities sum to 1:
sum(fit_tuyl[1, ])
# And this is true for all 49 observations:
apply(fit_tuyl, 1, sum)

# But again, the probabilities for any given individual are strictly positive. 
# Example: for individual 1:
sum(fit_tuyl[1, ] > 0)

# MC sampling:
tic()
uncertainty_tuyl <- tuyl(40000, Z)
toc() # 37 sec

dim(uncertainty_tuyl)  # 49  14  40000

# The individual-level count probability means over the MC samples:
uncertainty_tuyl_mean <- apply(uncertainty_tuyl, c(1, 2), mean)

# And we can plot the individual-level count probabilities. 
# Here we do so for the 1st individual (observation):
data.frame(x = factor(colnames(Z)), y = fit_tuyl[1, ]) |>
  prob.plot() +
  ggtitle("Tuyl fit Obs 1")

# Compare to the MC means (plots are basically the same):
data.frame(x = factor(colnames(Z)), y = uncertainty_tuyl_mean[1, ]) |>
  prob.plot() +
  ggtitle("Tuyl Monte Carlo mean Obs 1")

# remove the very large uncertainty_tuyl object:
rm(uncertainty_tuyl)
```

## ZIDM model
```{r fit-ZIDM-model-no-covariates, results='hide'}
# REMINDER: 49 individuals (obs), 14 genera
# dim(Z)

# Fit the ZIDM model to the data (increasing the iterations to 20,000, thinning every 10th)
tic()
fit_ZIDM <- ZIDM_R(Z, iterations = 20000)
toc()

# Obtain estimates from ZIDM
ZIDM_est <- estimates_ZIDM(zidm_obj = fit_ZIDM, burnin = 1000, CI = 0.95)
```

### Understanding the ZIDM model
Let's look at the model components.

```{r understand-ZIDM-model}
names(ZIDM_est) %>% 
  make_kable()
## Population-level zero-inflation probabilities:
# post_theta
# post_theta_lower
# post_theta_upper

## Population-level count probabilities:
# post_gamma
# post_gamma_lower
# post_gamma_upper

## individual-level count probabilities:
# post_psi
# post_psi_lower
# post_psi_upper
```
### Individual-level probabilities
```{r ZIDM-model-individual-level-probs, results='hide'}
# individual-level count probabilities:
dim(ZIDM_est$post_psi)  # 49 obs 14 genera

# The estimated probs for individual (observation) 1, for the 14 genera:
ZIDM_est$post_psi[1, ]

# And converted to relative abundances (maybe a little easier to decifer):
ZIDM_est$post_psi[1, ]*100

# the individual-level probs do sum to 1 for each of the 49 individuals:
apply(ZIDM_est$post_psi, 1, sum)

# NOTE: compared to the DM model, some individual-level count probabilities COULD BE set to 0!
# However, that's not the case with these data -- all individual-level probabilities are >0
apply(ZIDM_est$post_psi, MARGIN = 1, function(x) sum(ZIDM_est$post_psi[x, ] == 0))

# Plot the individual-level probs for obs 1:
data.frame(x = factor(colnames(Z)), y = ZIDM_est$post_psi[1, ]) |>
  # Plot the data:
  prob.plot() +
  ggtitle("ZIDM model Obs 1")

# We see that the estimated probs are very similar to what we saw with the DM and Tuyl models
```

## `ZIDM` with variable selection (`ZIDMbvs` method)

In this section, we apply the `ZIDMbvs` model to identify covariates associated with zero-inflation and compositional counts. 

By default the model is run for $10,000$ iterations, thinning to every $10^{th}$ iteration. 

Based on the experience with this data thus far, I am going to run for $40,000$ iterations thinning every $10^{th}$ iteration.

We assume the same covariates (X) are potentially associated with zero-inflation and with the compositional counts.

The output of the model contains MCMC samples for $\varphi$, $\beta_\gamma$, $\eta$, $\beta_\theta$, $\zeta$, $\omega$, $c$, and the acceptance probability of $\eta$ (`eta_accept`). These components of the model are explained in the [Koslovsky (2023) paper](https://doi.org/10.1111/biom.13853).

### Model convergence
To demonstrate the convergence of the algorithm, we plot the number of active terms in the model over MCMC iterations

```{r ZIDMbvs-assess-convergence}
# What the next line does: sums across the array's third dimension
y <- apply(fit_ZIDMbvs$zeta, 3, sum)
x <- 1:length(y)
dat <- data.frame(x, y)

conv1 <-  
  ggplot(dat, aes(x, y)) + 
  geom_line(aes(x = x, y = y)) + 
  labs(x = "MCMC Sample", y = "Count",  title = " At-Risk Indicator Active Terms") + 
  theme(title = element_text(size = 10))


y <- apply(fit_ZIDMbvs$varphi, 3, sum)
x <- 1:length(y)
dat <- data.frame(x, y)
conv2 <-  
  ggplot(dat, aes(x, y)) + 
  geom_line(aes(x = x, y = y)) + 
  labs(x = "MCMC Sample", y = "Count",  title = "Compositional Count Active Terms") + 
  theme(title = element_text(size = 10))

conv1 + conv2
```
### MPPIs 
Inclusion is determined with the marginal posterior probability of inclusion (MPPI) for each compositional element-by-covariate inclusion indicator. By default, the MPPI threshold for significant terms is set to $0.50$. 

However, as with the past model fits, I think we may have to use a lower threshold. 

The plots of the corresponding MPPIs for both levels of the model are presented below. The horizontal dotted line indicates the selection threshold. Covariates with corresponding MPPIs above $0.40$ are considered active in the model.

```{r ZIDMbvs-plot-MPPI, results='hide'}
# What this is doing:
# Over the last 2000 mcmc samples (when you have convergence), the mean for each taxon and covariate: 
MPPI_varphi <- apply(fit_ZIDMbvs$varphi[, , 2001:4000], c(1, 2), mean)

### Heatmap summaries 
We use a heatmap to visualize the associations between the genera and covariates as identified by the model. 

#### Selection threhold = $0.40$
```{r ZIDMbvs-heatmap-0.4, results='hide'}
# Matt sent me the code for the heatmap. He uses the pheatmap package.

# REMINDER:
dim(X)  # 49 observations  14 covariates
dim(Z)  # 49 observations  14 taxa (genera)

# Will need the names for the matrix of coefs later:
# colnames(X)
# colnames(Z)

# Set the selection threshold:
selection_threshold <- 0.45

# The posterior inclusion probabilities for the compositional count associations:
MPPI_varphi <- apply(fit_ZIDMbvs$varphi[ , , 2001:4000], c(1, 2), mean)
# Remove the intercept:
MPPI.phi <- MPPI_varphi[, -1] 
# MPPI threshold for significant terms is set to selection_threshold:
MPPI.phi <- (MPPI.phi > selection_threshold)*1
# The coefficients:
beta_gamma <- apply(fit_ZIDMbvs$beta_gamma[ , , 2001:4000], c(1, 2), mean)[, -1]

# Both objects are the same dimension (as they should be):
# dim(MPPI.phi)
# dim(beta_gamma)

# Multiply the matrices to get the coefs to keep, the others set to zero:
coef.cc <- MPPI.phi*beta_gamma

# The posterior inclusion probabilities for the at-risk (zero-inflation) counts:
MPPI_zeta <- apply(fit_ZIDMbvs$zeta[ , , 2001:4000], c(1, 2), mean) 
MPPI.zeta <- MPPI_zeta[, -1]
MPPI.zeta <- (MPPI.zeta > selection_threshold)*1
# The coefficients:
beta_theta <- apply(fit_ZIDMbvs$beta_theta[ , , 2001:4000], c(1, 2), mean)[, -1]

# dim(MPPI.zeta)
# dim(beta_theta)

coef.zi <- MPPI.zeta*beta_theta

# The final matrix of the coefs:
foo <- coef.cc + coef.zi

dim(foo)  # 14 taxa  14 covariates

# CHECK: the range of the coefs (to determine how to set the breaks for the color palette below):
foo |>
  c() |>
  range()


# CHECK: the non-zero entries:
###
# colnames(foo) <- colnames(X)
# mz <-
#   foo %>%
#   # convert the matrix to a tibble:
#   as_tibble(foo) %>%
#   # add column of the taxon names at the beginning:
#   dplyr::mutate(taxon = colnames(Z), .before = everything())
# 
# mz %>%
#   # going to perform operations rowwise:
#   dplyr::rowwise() %>%
#   # getting to the non-zero entries:
#   dplyr::mutate(total = sum(c_across(where(is.numeric)))) %>%
#   dplyr::filter(!total == 0) %>%
#   dplyr::select(where(~ any(. != 0)))
